## About
Everything on this website is written by me, Brayden Yates, unless otherwise stated. Everything in this site is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA unless otherwise stated. 

## So who are you?
I was born in south-central Kentucky, and I currently live in central Kentucky. 

I have a deep love for learning, and this blog feels necessary to share my thoughts and realizations with others. I am currently pursuing a degree in Music Education, and I will often write about my philosophy of music and views on education. I consider myself multifaceted, though, so I will not limit myself to writing about these things. 

Politically, I'd consider myself a Classical Liberal with an interest in Austrian Economics. When I discuss politics, people tend to think I'm a walking contradiction. My personal views are often somewhat conservative--being a Christian--but my political views are fairly liberal. I plan to clarify on this in a few blog posts over time. I have opinions on numerous things, and I'm happy to discuss just about anything. I try to understand everything that I can, and I try to improve myself every day. 

I tend to think that political and social change is made on an individual level, rather than collectively. In matters that cannot be managed at the individual level, a government and legislature is necessary, but I believe it should be minimal. In my view, local and state governments should have more power than the federal government. I believe that smaller states and governments represent more homogeneous populations, which in turn leads to more prosperous communities and diverse forms of governance. In essence, I government should be structured more like a confederation and less like the federation we see in America today. 

I live in Kentucky, and I plan to buy a homestead once I graduate college and settle in a location. 

## What are your other interests?
I love tinkering with electronics. I have an Ender 3 v2 3d printer, and I typically print with PLA. I'm not the best at 3d printing, but I'll print things off and mail them to you at material cost for crypto. 

I also enjoy designing ridiculous machines using arduinos. Eventually, I'll get around to posting them here. 

I am also studying for my Amateur Radio license. I'm taking my exam on 22 October 2020, and I'll most likely post information about that here as I dabble in that.

My favorite programming language is Python, and occasionally I'll come up with a project that utilizes it. 

I also pick locks as a hobby, though it's a skill I'm refining. Eventually I'd like to design and make my own tools.
